# ML-Monster_Type_Recongition
This project is about an interesting experimental data set called Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo! which was used in a competition 5 years ago as a classification problem. The aim of the problem is to construct a method for identifying the type of a "monster" (Ghoul, Goblin or Ghost) according to the value of five (5) numerical characteristics (such as hair length, etc.). The 5th attribute is the color of the monster and has 6 discrete values (discrete values) versus the others which are continuous values features. The methods of classification we examined are k-NN , Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Na√Øve Bayes classifier.
